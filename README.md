## Getting Started

Before installing and using uswds-rails, you'll want to have Ruby 2.2.9 (or newer) installed on your computer. There are plenty of ways to go about this, but my preference is [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv). If you're developing on a Mac and using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh), installing rbenv is [super easy](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv#homebrew-on-mac-os-x).

uswds-rails _might_ work with other versions of Ruby, but it's developed in 2.5.1 and automatically tested against 2.2.9, 2.3.8, 2.4.6, and 2.5.1 by [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/jgarber623/uswds-rails).

## Installation

Add uswds-rails to your Ruby on Rails project's Gemfile:

```rb
ruby '2.5.1'

source 'https://rubygems.org'
source 'https://rails-assets.org'

gem 'rails', '~> 5.1'
gem 'uswds-rails', '~> 1.4'
```

Run `bundle install` to install uswds-rails and its dependencies.

## Usage

uswds-rails makes available to your Rails application the fonts, images, JavaScript files, and stylesheets from the U.S. Web Design System. Including the files varies depending on type.

The most basic integration looks like:

```scss
// In `app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss`
@import "uswds/uswds";
```

```js
// In `app/assets/javascripts/application.js`
//= require "uswds/uswds";
```

Adding those lines to your project's `application.scss` and `application.js` will include _everything_ from the U.S. Web Design System (fonts, JavaScript, and stylesheets).

Don't want to include the entire stylesheet in your project? Not to worry! You may include individual SCSS files by using uswds-rails' [`app/assets/stylesheets/uswds/uswds.scss`](https://github.com/jgarber623/uswds-rails/blob/master/app/assets/stylesheets/uswds/uswds.scss) as a guide.
